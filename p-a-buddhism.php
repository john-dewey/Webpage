            <h3>Abstract</h3>


            &emsp; Buddhism is world religion that is held in high regards internationally as a religion of
            peace. Buddhism arrived in Japan in the 6th century CE, establishing many schools of thought
            and became a prevalent part of Japanese culture. Buddhism was also present during one of the
            darkest periods of Japanese history when infamously known as a hegemonic imperialist. This
            paper will investigate the state of Buddhism from the advent of the Japanese Empire until its end
            in World War IIâ€”Investigating the relationship between Japanese Buddhism and Japanese
            nationalism.
