                    <web-body> &emsp;&emsp;The idea for Dunhall was to have a prominent and extensive rail network. I
                            think trains are a nice way to bring people who may live in a town or neighborhood to the
                            epicenter of a city. In my own experience, as a kid I would take a Metro-North train from
                            Beacon, NY to Grand Central in NYC. That option is superior to the car, which would be a
                            nightmare trying to find a parking spot in NYC and the inescapable traffic in the Bronx. The
                            rail network of Dunhall connects all sattelite towns to the main station, and there is a
                            metro network that connects neighborhoods of Dunhall to the main station. The main station
                            is centrally located in the Downtown with frontage of a main square, which has entertainment
                            and beaucratic function, as Dunhall acts as a regional capitol. The capitol building is
                            opposite of station in the square. This building is an Art-Deco inspired Skyscraper that
                            holds all legislative function for the state, and there is even office and commercial spaces
                            for rent.
