            <p>
                &emsp; In America, the LGBTQIA+ Movement (simplified to LGBT+) is a famous organization that
                comprises of misrepresented sexual orientations and gender identities. The movement has been
                successful in America for establishing support groups that mitigate LGBT+ isolation, pressuring
                lawmakers into providing LGBT+ with legal protections, and the decrease of LGBT+
                discrimination in the United States. The movement was essential in establishing protections for
                the future generations which definitely benefit from their sacrifices to this day. However, the
                acceptance of LGBT+ is disproportionally accepted across the world. Some nations outright
                consider homosexuality a capital crime, while other nations keep LGBT+ in a segregated state.
                Unfortunately for Japan, they fall into this classification of a nation. Therefore, it is worth studying
                the state of LGBT+ protection in Japan for sake of determining the welfare of LGBT+ individuals
                in Japan. This paper aims to investigate the paradigms of Japanese LBGT+ movements, their
                fights for equality, and establish a clear standing of Japanese treatment of LGBT+.
