&ensp;&ensp;I am excited to announce that on May 4<sup>th</sup>, 2024, I graduated from Furman University with a B.S. Computer Science, B.A. Japanese Studies, and Cum Laude Honors. It was a tough but rewarding last semester at Furman. Last semester, I took Data Mining, Game Design, and two Senior Thesis Projects for both of my majors. For Computer Science, I completed the thesis <i> Context-Driven English to Japanese Translation  </i>which implemented a Statistical Machine Translator
that could process grammatically correct English sentences and translate them
into an equivalent Japanese phrase. The project was coded in Java and uses SQL,
Linguistic Corpora, and a Visitor design pattern to facilitate translation algorithms.
For Japanese, I completed the thesis  <i>Discrepancies among Translation: A
Comparison Between English and Japanese Linguistic Properties</i>  which investigated
the linguistic properties of English and Japanese and their differences to
explain the complexity of such a property and a procedure for translation.
Completing these projects was rewarding in that I was able to expand my knowledge
on a topic I find interesting, but finally be able to apply my skills from
Computer Science and Japanese Studies.
<br>&ensp; &ensp;Now that I have graduated, I am on an active job hunt for roles in the Software and IT industries. I plan on moving to Boston, MA to be closer to my friends and family, but to also enjoy
the ambience of one of my favorite cities in the United States. I am looking forward to the new memories to be made there, and the new experiences and
connections waiting for me. 
<br>&ensp;&ensp; Otherwise, I am spending my downtime packing, visiting friends, and playing Cities: Skylines. In Cities, I am currently working on my megacity Diamanti which is currently at 150,000 citizens (large for the game s computer).
