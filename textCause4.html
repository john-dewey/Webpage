      The LGBTQIA+ is an acronym for a group of people advocating for the protection of a person’s sexual orientation and gender identity. The ‘T’ in the acronym represents Transgender. Transgender people in America continue to be the most targeted and marginalized group. In fact, Black Trans-Women are the most likely demographic to be victim of a hate crime. This vibrant community known for the insurmountable influence on the LGBTQIA+ cause continues to be undermined, and their livelihoods must be protected.
