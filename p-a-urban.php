                &emsp; Final Project for Urban Studies at Waseda SILS. The project investigates the history of
                Urban Planning decisions in the Bronx that contribute to the disenfranchisement of People of Color (POC)
                communities.

                &emsp; The American cities that were once revered with opulence are now shadows of that former
                glory. Since the beginning of the 20th Century, American cities started to change due to a multitude
                of factors. These factors have completely changed the social fabric of cities. However, they mainly
                disproportionally affected people of color's (POC) communities in the United States. Over a
                century later, we can see the consequences of decisions made by urban planners. These decisions
                have protected white Americans while disenfranchising POC communities. This paper will
                investigate how a multitude of urban planning decisions in the 20th century has perpetually
                excluded POC communities in the Bronx of New York City.
