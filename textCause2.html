        Since the founding of the United States segregation between Whites and People of Color have been a part of American planning. While history focuses on the explicit forms of segregation throughout the Jim Crow era, other cities beyond the Southern U.S. implemented segregation planning such as “Redlining” and “Urban Renewal” which disproportionally affected People of Color and prohibit them from creating community wealth. This website shows the history and effects of segregation by design.</cause-text>
