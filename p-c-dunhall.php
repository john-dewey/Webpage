                    <p> &emsp;&emsp;The idea for Dunhall was to have a prominent and extensive rail network. I
                        think trains are a nice way to bring people who may live in a town or neighborhood to the
                        epicenter of a city. In my own experience, as a kid I would take a Metro-North train from
                        Beacon, NY to Grand Central in NYC. That option is superior to the car, which would be a
                        nightmare trying to find a parking spot in NYC and the inescapable traffic in the Bronx. The
                        rail network of Dunhall connects all sattelite towns to the main station, and there is a
                        metro network that connects neighborhoods of Dunhall to the main station. The main station
                        is centrally located in the Downtown with frontage of a main square, which has entertainment
                        and beaucratic function, as Dunhall acts as a regional capitol. The capitol building is
                        opposite of station in the square. This building is an Art-Deco inspired Skyscraper that
                        holds all legislative function for the state, and there is even office and commercial spaces
                        for rent.
