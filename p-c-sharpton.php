                        <web-body>&emsp;I started this map in an attempt to break away from my usual comfort zoners. I was a
                            fanatic with grids and would use that as the more often than I liked. Of course grids are
                            nice, so long as they have a walkable block size and good transit options. Which brings me
                            to my second issue--public transit' the American in me is used to a car being a main mode of
                            transit. In reality, this mode of transit is expensive and unrealistic. Sharpton has an
                            impressive subway and train system, as long as a an extensive freeway with elaborate
                            interchanges. Sharpton also has a downtown grid, but outside of the downtown you can see
                            more organic growth in terms of block and lot sizes. Sharpton has 2 sattelite cities which
                            are conected by train and ferry options. Unfortunately, this project is discontinued due to
                            mods breaking the save file. </web-body>
